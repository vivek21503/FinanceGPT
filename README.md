Our goal is to create a financial sentiment analysis system leveraging daily news and articles for Indian market trend prediction. Additionally, we aim to develop a RAG-based system to address user queries from complex financial reports and articles, facilitating easier comprehension and decision-making.

## Key Features


* Integrated Reference System: Links text in financial statements with related tables for comprehensive context.
* Enhanced Retrieval Accuracy: Employs a combination of BERT and TF-IDF embeddings for fast and precisely retrieving text and tables from financial documents.
* RAG-Based Financial Analysis Tool: Utilizes a tailored RAG approach for improved navigation and comprehension of financial statements.
* Modern UI
  - Host the query output portal and make a WEB ChatBot.

## Methodology

For document reading and preprocessing we used  PyPDF2 which extracts the text while Camelot reads tables. Now what we did was  we segmented text  into 100-word chunks with a 30-word overlap and converted table data into .txt files.

Then we used data mapping and word embeddings to establish a connection between text chunks and tables. Word embeddings help to transform textual data into numerical formats and for contextual understanding.

For the contextual analysis part, we used a combination of two models, the TF-IDF model to handle known stocks while the Bert model manages generalized financial data. We then used Llama 2.0, integrating embeddings and contextual data for advanced predictions.

Now we compared outputs from Llama and Falcon models to refine the selection based on the accuracy and relevance of financial predictions.

## Pipeline

	Initially, we gathered financial reports and articles concerning the Nifty 50 stocks. These documents were then segmented into 
 	chunks, each consisting of 100 words with a 30-word overlap. To enhance data accessibility, we mapped the tables within PDFs to 
  	these chunks and organized the information into a structured database.
		  
	Subsequently, we enriched the database by incorporating TF-IDF embeddings and BERT embeddings for efficient data retrieval. Additionally, 
 	we supplemented this financial text data with fundamental data relating to the respective stocks. When a user query is submitted, we 
  	leverage cosine similarity to identify the most relevant chunks from the database. These selected chunks, along with the user query, 
	associated tables, and fundamental data, are then passed through the Llama 2.0 model which caters to the user query thereby providing the 
 	best results.
